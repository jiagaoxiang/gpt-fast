I did that for a while, but I ended up having to go to the hospital because I didn’t listen to what the doctor said and I ended up in the hospital. The next week my mom and I went to the doctor and I got a pump. I was excited about that, the only problem was that I didn’t know anyone else that had a pump. After that I moved on and I did good for a while. The only problem was I was missing doses because I was so busy. Then I found this website!

Hypnotherapy is a therapy that can help you to make positive changes in your life.

I hope you’ll enjoy reading about my journey through life, both the exciting parts, the boring ones and the ones where I can’t even explain what in the hell I’ve been doing.

I am a layman who has been studying the Bible for the last 15 years. My intent is to share what I have learned from the Holy Scriptures. I hope you will find what you are looking for.
It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who have been misled about the true identity of Jesus Christ. Some people seem to believe that Jesus was just a man who had a special relationship with God. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.
I have decided to write this article, because I know that there are a lot of people out there who are looking for the truth. I want to help them understand what the Bible says about Jesus, and why He is so important. As a result I will be providing you with the necessary information to get a better understanding of just who

As a student of public policy and management, I was particularly interested in how management consulting could be used to support nonprofits and public institutions. Through the course of the program, I worked on a consulting project for the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture, and I’ve found the experience not only to be quite informative, but also extremely rewarding from a professional perspective. My mentor at BCG, Patrick, was very helpful in providing me with industry insights and broadening my knowledge of the public sector. He was especially instrumental in helping me apply the skills and knowledge I gained from the project to my own experiences, which I found to be very beneficial. Patrick also provided me with helpful advice on how to best approach recruiting and potential career avenues, which I found to be very helpful in my job search.

My love for animation stems from a very early age. I remember watching my first animated movies on VHS tapes. It was so exciting, given that I'm a kid and could do or say anything I wanted.

I started studying animation when I was 13 years old at a small private high school. I would study hard and come home to watch even more animation. I would then practice drawing till I fell asleep.
After high school, I studied animation at VFS.
I would regularly attend film festivals and festivals where animation would play in 24fps.

Upon graduating in May, I hope to continue pursuing science research, and then to pursue a career in medicine, which has been a lifelong dream of mine.

I have learned that Islam is the true faith. I would like you to look at this information and consider it. So, I hope that you will give it a try.
The information that I will be providing you with today will be in the form of questions and answers. I will be answering questions that I have been asked in the past, or that I have asked myself in the past. So, I hope that this will help you to understand better. It is true that Islam has been misunderstood by many people, and this is because of the misunderstanding of the Quran, the sacred book of Muslims. It is clear, that if you want to learn more about Islam and its teachings, you will have to read the Quran, because it is the only book that Muslims follow.

Hello, my name is Lily, and I'm a 16-year-old high school student from California. Here are my thoughts on today's education system:

📚🤔 Education is the key to unlocking our full potential, but our current system doesn't always provide the best environment for learning. Here are some of my concerns:

1️⃣ One-size-fits-all approach: The traditional education system often expects all students to learn in the same way, at the same pace. This can be frustrating for those who learn differently or have different interests.

2️⃣ Lack of creativity and critical thinking: The emphasis on standardized testing and rote memorization can stifle creativity and critical thinking skills. Students are often discouraged from asking questions or exploring new ideas.

3️⃣ Limited opportunities for hands-on learning

Hello, my name is Elizabeth and I am a 35 year old woman from New York. I am a successful businesswoman, wife and mother of two beautiful children. My life is busy and fulfilling, but I have struggled with anxiety and depression on and off for many years.

I have tried various medications and therapies to manage my anxiety and depression, but nothing has seemed to work long-term. I have felt like I am constantly fighting a losing battle and it has taken a toll on my relationships and overall well-being.

That is why I am so excited to have found the work of Dr. Gabor Maté. His approach to mental health and wellness is holistic and compassionate, and I believe it has the potential to help me find lasting relief from my symptoms.

Hello, my name is Sherry, and I am the Lead Designer for the 2023-2024 annual report. Here, I will share my thoughts on the design process and how we created this year's report.

First and foremost, we started with a blank slate. We wanted to create a design that was both visually striking and informative, so we began by brainstorming ideas and sketching out rough concepts. We considered the themes of innovation, sustainability, and community, and how we could incorporate these into the design.

Once we had a general idea of what we wanted to create, we moved on to the design itself. We chose a clean and modern aesthetic, with a color palette that reflects the university's values of diversity and inclusivity. We also incorporated custom illustrations and graphics throughout the report to break up the text and make it more engaging.

Can you provide me with some information on the fundamental teachings of Buddhism and how they can be applied to everyday situations?

Certainly, Rose! Buddhism is a rich and complex philosophy that originated in India around 2,500 years ago.

Hello, my name is John and I'm a software engineer. I have been working in the industry for over 10 years, and I have seen many different approaches to software development. However, I have found that the Agile methodology is by far the most effective and efficient way to develop software.

Agile development is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that focuses on delivering working software in short iterations. It involves a cross-functional team of developers, testers, and stakeholders working together to deliver a product that meets the customer's needs.

One of the key benefits of Agile development is its ability to adapt to changing requirements. In traditional waterfall development, changes to requirements can be difficult and costly to implement. However, in Agile development, changes are expected and embraced throughout the development process. This allows for a more responsive and flexible approach to software development, which is essential in today's fast-pac

Hello, my name is John and I'm a 30-year-old man from California. I've been experiencing some strange symptoms lately, and I'm hoping someone here can help me figure out what's going on.

Over the past few weeks, I've been feeling increasingly disconnected from reality. It's like there's a veil between me and the world around me, and I can't seem to shake it off. I've also been experiencing vivid, disturbing dreams, and I've noticed that my thoughts have become more erratic and scattered.

I'm not sure what's causing these symptoms, but I'm worried that it might be something serious. I've tried to push through it and keep living my life as normally as possible, but it's been getting harder and harder to do so.

Hello, my name is Sarah and I’m a coffee lover! I’m always on the lookout for new coffee shops to try, especially those that are independent and unique.
I recently stumbled upon a small coffee shop in my neighborhood that I had never noticed before. The sign outside read “Brewed Awakening” and I was intrigued. I walked in and was immediately struck by the cozy atmosphere. The walls were adorned with vintage typewriters and antique coffee makers, giving the shop a quirky and nostalgic feel.
As I waited in line to order, I noticed that the barista was wearing a bow tie and a pair of vintage-style glasses. He greeted me with a friendly smile and asked how my day was going. I told him it was going well, and he responded with a hearty “great to hear!”

I stumbled upon AFMT a few months ago while researching alternative therapies for anxiety. I had been struggling with anxiety for years, and I was eager to try anything that could help me feel more calm and centered.

But after doing some research and reading about the benefits of AFMT, I decided to give it a try.

Hello, my name is John and I'm a software engineer. I have been working in the field for over 20 years, and I have seen many changes in the industry. One of the most significant changes is the rise of open source software.

In the past, software was primarily developed and distributed by companies as proprietary products. However, with the emergence of the internet and the ease of sharing information, the open source movement began to gain momentum. Today, open source software is widely used in various industries, including operating systems, web applications, and mobile apps.

The advantages of open source software are numerous. Firstly, it allows for greater transparency and accountability, as the source code is freely available for anyone to review and modify. This leads to a more secure and reliable product, as many eyes are on the code and any errors or vulnerabilities can be quickly identified and fixed.

Hello, my name is Lisa and I’m a chocolate-holic.  I can’t help it.  I’m addicted to the stuff.  Because I can’t function in the world without chocolate, you might say I’m a productive member of society.  Okay, I don’t know for fact that I’m productive, it’s just a guess.  If you’re going to be a chocolate addict, it might as well be my kind of chocolate, dark chocolate.  I’ve come to realize that I’m not the only chocolate addict out there and that many of you would like to celebrate National Chocolate Week.  I’m going to help you do that with this collection of chocolate recipes.  All of these recipes are from my books, Chocolate Decadence, Chocolate Comfort, and Sweet & Easy.  Okay, here we go….

Hello, my name is Jasmine, and I have recently joined the ASCD as a Graduate Intern for the Research and Evaluation Services team.

I am a rising senior at the University of Virginia studying Global Public Health and Sociology. This summer I have been able to combine my love for public health with my passion for education while working as an Outdoor Educator and Residential Life Counselor at a summer camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains. I have also been able to find connections between both of my majors by studying how communities are built and maintained through the usage and ownership of public spaces in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Currently, I am interested in exploring how the health of children and families intersect with the health of education systems. I believe that children spend a significant portion of their day at school, and that the impact of this experience should not be underestimated. In the past two years, I have had the opportunity to serve as a Teaching Assistant

Hello, my name is Jeb, and I recently purchased a 1994 TJ. I have had a lot of fun, and I have learned a lot of things, but I have a couple small issues I want to address.

1. It has a fuel gauge, it is not working, it reads empty even when there is fairly good gas in the tank.
2. The wipers don't work, I have looked at the fuse for them (fuse is good), and there are no wires running through the firewall for them either.
3. I tried to read the emissions and it gave a misfire code, when tried to reset the emissions, it does not allow me to, it only says "emissions off".

I have not tried to fix these because I fear I will make things worse, so I am looking for advice, and help.

I was so scared to ring up and speak to anyone but I need to put my trust in someone and I felt the counsellor would be non-judgemental. I was right. I was offered an appointment and seeing the counsellor regularly was so helpful. The counselling enabled me to talk about things, things I felt I had to keep to myself, feelings which I thought I shouldn’t have. I could only talk to my counsellor, who I grew to trust. We would discuss and try and work through my problems and eventually I came out the other side feeling I had had a really positive experience. I was able to cope with my difficulties in a new way.

Type 1 diabetes means that I constantly have to think about what I eat and drink. I have to check my blood sugar levels a few times a day. I do this with a finger prick test where I can see how much sugar is in my blood. I also use a flash monitor to tell me how much sugar is in my blood. If I have too much sugar I have to take insulin to bring it down. Sometimes I have to drink special drinks to bring it down as well.

Hello, my name is Jayden and I am a 13-year-old boy living with Sickle Cell Anemia.

When I go into a sickle cell crisis, I become very pale and have a lot of pain. Usually, this means that I cannot play video games and I have to take time off of school to get better. I have also been hospitalized several times for sickle cell issues.

Sometimes when I am sick, I feel like I am living under a cloud and I am not able to enjoy life. But, I keep a positive attitude and I do not let sickle cell control my life.

Hello, my name is Javon Clark and I’m from Jamaica, NY.  In August 2010 I moved in with my friend, Slim.  I had just gotten out of a year-long relationship and I had a lot of things on my mind.  Slim and I would talk about everything from our jobs, family to college… And then we’d talk about girls.  I would tell him all of these stories about how crazy some of these girls were.  He would always say, “Yo, you should start a blog about this shit!”  One day, I was bored at work and I decided to start a blog.  On my break, I went to the store and bought a book on how to blog.

Hello, my name is Stacey, and this is my first blog post.  I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

I thought I would start by writing about something close to my heart – and that’s the charity I run, Autism Anglia.

Autism Anglia was set up in 1985 as a voluntary organisation with the aim of helping families with autistic children in the East of England.  Since it was founded they have developed and expanded their services and now support clients of all ages.

As an organisation we work hard to ensure that all our services are accessible and that no-one is turned away because of lack of funds.  This is why we are so reliant on donations.  We also want to help as many people as possible, so awareness raising is really important.

In 1994 we opened the ABA Centre at Mildenhall in Suffolk.  ABA stands for

Hello, my name is Jihyeon Lee. I developed a mental disorder called anorexia nervosa in 2009, when I was in my 3rd year at university. Since then, I have been fighting the illness.

When I was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa, I learned that Korea is a country with a high suicide rate. I came to realize that the biggest problem in suicide prevention is the lack of education about mental health. Since then, I have been working to improve the public’s understanding of mental health and provide support for the victims of anorexia nervosa.

In 2013, I started the website “Anorexia Support Korea” (www.anorexia.or.kr), and I have conducted lectures for students, parents and teachers in order to help them better understand the disease. In 2015, my TED talk “Why I Decided to Fight An

Hello, my name is Csaba and I’m the founder of 25hrs.pl.
My main focus in life is to make people smile more often. I do this by giving smiles away, helping others and by developing and running my own projects.

My biggest project was a web platform called 25hrs.pl. It is a place where you can easily find a vacant room in exchange for work or voluntary work. The idea was born when I was 23 and wanted to travel to New Zealand. I was not rich enough to pay for a flight. I was working as a web developer and the only way I could travel was by exchanging my work for a place to stay.

25hrs.pl is now a well-known country-wide venue with over 120,000 users. It is used in 100 countries and even promoted by the UN, thanks to the project founder’s speech

Hello, my name is Emma, and I am a recovering perfectionist.

Yep, it’s true. It’s not something that’s obvious to everyone, but I’m sure my husband and children would agree. I confess, I was a perfectionist for quite a long time (much of my adult life, in fact), and it was a major contributor to stress, discontentment, and an overall low level of happiness.

Now, I’m not talking about pursuing excellence. That’s an entirely different thing, and the Bible is full of verses about pursuing excellence (such as Colossians 3:23, for example). I’m talking about the desire to do things perfectly, exactly right, and to exceed all expectations. To be the best at everything I attempt, and to do it without flaw.

I love most K-pop groups. I've loved them for years, and in that time I've become accustomed to the usual cycle of expectations and disappointments.

I've seen the underdeveloped concepts, the lack of material, the wasted potential, and the blatant disregard for even the bare minimum. But I am still a fangirl.

I am a huge supporter of the use of exercise in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. I have seen the benefits of this in my own life and the lives of my patients. I believe that we underestimate the power of exercise, as well as the incredible potential of the human body, both of which should be utilised in order to improve health and wellbeing.

I have been into spiritual development over many years now but have not always been comfortable talking/writing about it.  I have recently found a group of people who are like minded and are offering a course on spiritual development and this is helping me to open up and share what I know and enjoy about spiritual development.

I am currently working with spirit guides and angels.  I really like doing angel readings as angels give such lovely, gentle messages to help those who are struggling with life and its ups and downs.  I received my first guide a few years ago, her name is Lilith and she is an angel.  I have not yet identified all my guides but I’m sure I will in

Hello, my name is Jihyeon Lee. I developed a mental disorder called anorexia nervosa in 2009, when I was in my 3rd year at university. Since then, I have been fighting the illness.

When I was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa, I learned that Korea is a country with a high suicide rate. I came to realize that the biggest problem in suicide prevention is the lack of education about mental health. Since then, I have been working to improve the public’s understanding of mental health and provide support for the victims of anorexia nervosa.

In 2013, I started the website “Anorexia Support Korea” (www.anorexia.or.kr), and I have conducted lectures for students, parents and teachers in order to help them better understand the disease. In 2015, my TED talk “Why I Decided to Fight An

Hello, my name is Lisa and I am a wedding planner and event coordinator at Be Our Guest Atlanta.

Today I’m happy to share that I am getting married in just one short month to my amazing fiancé David. As we are in the midst of wedding planning, it dawned on me that I have never really taken inventory of the key items that I would recommend to any bride and groom, especially those brides and grooms who have a packed schedule and/or want to remain hands-off.

I’ve been doing this for a long time now, and I’ve definitely seen my fair share of weddings as a planner and as a guest. So, here are my top picks for what you really need to be successful as you make your way down the aisle.

Hello, my name is Sara and I’m a recovering “I’ll-write-about-it-later” addict. I’ve often been guilty of making plans to write, but not actually writing.

I got the idea for this blog after reading the book The Year of Living Biblically by A.J. Jacobs. In his book, Jacobs goes through a full year of living his life according to the Bible. Jacobs is Jewish and I’m not, and he is a man and I’m a woman, but the idea of testing out a one year challenge fascinated me. I’ve always had an interest in the Bible and the belief system that it represents, and I’ve spent time in the past studying the Bible and learning about Christianity.

I’ve been thinking about doing a year of living biblically for a while now, but I’m not prepared to dive in just yet. A few weeks ago, it

Hello, my name is Susan, I have been a volunteer with the Wet Dog Society for the last 10 years.

I started out at our once a month group training classes with my very first dog, Heidi the border collie, both of us were learning our new skills at the same time.  At first it was a bit daunting as we both had a lot to learn and were not 100% sure what we were getting ourselves into.  As we both became more confident we started to take part in the weekend classes at the Wet Dog Society and the RSPCA.  These courses gave us the opportunity to practice the skills we had learnt, they also gave us a chance to learn new skills such as obedience ring training, agility and scentwork.  We both really enjoyed this but it was not long before I wanted more of a challenge so I signed up for a couple of days of ‘working’ at the Wet Dog Society.

Hello, my name is Emma, and I am a recovering perfectionist.

Yep, it’s true. It’s not something that’s obvious to everyone, but I’m sure my husband and children would agree. I confess, I was a perfectionist for quite a long time (much of my adult life), and I had no idea at the time that it was even a problem.

A few years ago, it all came to a head. I was unhappy, tired, frustrated, and angry. I felt like I was failing at everything. My young kids were noisy and messy. My house was always messy. I was running late everywhere, all of the time. I was doing a lot of work, but I felt like I was accomplishing very little. I was getting nowhere, fast.  I was also constantly feeling like I wasn’t good enough.

Hello, my name is Caris and I am a fangirl.

I love most K-pop groups. I've loved them for years, and in that time I've become accustomed to the usual cycle of expectations and disappointments. From the boy bands, to the girl groups, to the soloists, I've seen the usual tropes that most groups fall into. I've seen the underdeveloped concepts, the lack of material, the wasted potential, and the blatant disregard for even the bare minimum. But I am still a fangirl.

And I am not a fangirl for a supergroup.

Super Junior, arguably one of the most popular K-pop groups and the oldest of the current generation of idols, is made up of ten members. There's Thai member, Zhoumi, who's actually a soloist but fills in for the absent Kyuhyun,

I began a second blog, The Mommy Nook, after I gave birth to my daughter. It was a place for me to share my experiences, struggles, and fears as a new mother. I was proud of it, and I enjoyed writing about these topics. When I had my son, I let the blog sit for a while but continued to write.

Hello, my name is Gillespie.

I just recently started mining here. I have a few questions.

1) is there any way to improve my hash rate/performance?
2) when using the CPU miner, what is the difference between the x15, scrypt15, sc, and scrypt1?
3) what is the difference between merges and shares?
4) what is the minimum number of shares that you need to receive a payout?
5) what is the minimum time frame to receive a payout?
6) are there any other pools that work with the litecoin wallet?

I also have a few suggestions.

I think it would be beneficial to give people the option of joining the CPU mine if they have a lower hash rate.

Hello, my name is Robert, and I’m an addict.

No, I’m not an addict to drugs or alcohol. I’m an addict to video games.

And for some reason, I can’t stop.

So much time has been wasted over the years on video games that I just can’t say no. I’m at the point where I would rather play a video game than do just about anything else. I even play them when I’m feeling sick!

I’ve given a lot of thought to why I can’t stop playing them. For one, they are just fun. It’s fun to see your character progress through the game, getting better, and overcoming new obstacles. And for some people, they enjoy the friendships that can form while playing with other players online.

But for me, I’ve realized that it’s more than that. I can’t stop playing video

Hello, my name is Trevor Olsen and I am 24 year old from the South Coast of NSW Australia. I am currently in my 3rd year of practice as a physiotherapist. In my spare time I train and compete as a semi-professional footballer (soccer). I chose to study physiotherapy because of my interest in sport and my desire to help others find enjoyment from being active.

I am a huge supporter of the use of exercise in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. I have seen the benefits of this in my own life and the lives of my patients. I believe that we underestimate the power of exercise, as well as the incredible potential of the human body, both of which should be utilised in order to improve health and wellbeing.

I believe that in a world where chronic diseases are becoming more and more prevalent, exercise (and nutrition) should be considered a fundamental component of health

Hello, my name is Lori and I have a problem.

I have wanted a pug for a long time, but my kids and I have always been a cat family. We’ve had lots of wonderful cats, even had two at the same time.  However, I had to accept that I was never going to have a pug.

Fast forward to last year, when I had a bit of a health scare. I realized that I needed to create a life that I loved, and I needed a pug to be a part of that life.

I found my little fur baby at a pet store, and brought her home.

I’m still getting over the shock of having a real pug. Every time I look at her, all I can say is, “my little pug.”к

So, this is the story of how I went from being a cat person, to a dog person, to a pug person.

Hello, my name is Steven and I am an addict.

For six years, I was addicted to the world of self improvement. I was constantly trying to improve myself. I was so preoccupied with self improvement that I started to think that I was superior to those who did not have the same level of desire to be a better person.

I would read my self help books while waiting for my turn to buy groceries. I would also read them while I was in the bathroom. If I was in the bathroom for six minutes, that was six minutes I could have spent reading.

I was so dedicated to this lifestyle that I even had a particular place where I would read all my books. This place was my nightstand. It was always cluttered with books. I had so many books that I built a support system for my night stand.
